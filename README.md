*tiny-rpg* is a fun turn-based RPG with a clear emphasis on being small. The game world is small, the window is small, the codebase is small and in C. The amount of dependencies is small, so on and so forth.

## Dependencies

- [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) <!-- very nice game dev framework -->
- [microtar](https://github.com/rxi/microtar) <!-- tar compression lib for saves and assets -->
- [microui](https://github.com/rxi/microui)   <!-- geez this rxi lad is carrying my game -->

Each dependency here is carefully chosen for a large amount of factors. Those boiling down to portability and general ease of use or implementation. Raylib was the best choice since it offers everything I could want for this project in a single monolithic library. Microtar was chosen since it's a simple `header/impl` file combo that allows me to use the efficient `tar` compression scheme for game assets and save data without needing to build my own tooling, very awesome. Microui was chosen for a similar reason, it's small, `header/impl` and it doesn't need much glue between it and Raylib to make UI happen.
